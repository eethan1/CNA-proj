# Smart Client

## Feature

### Client

- User Friendly Interface: If you key in unknown or invalid command, command line will feed back all commands you can use.

- Coool cmd-like style: Put a '$' symbol in front of every line, just like bash. If you have logged in, your username will also put before '$'. Example:  `eethan1$`

- Logout: Logout make you have choice to log in again instead of exiting. (However, it seems that the server haven't supported this feature)

### Server

- Thread-pool: enhance connection performance with reusable thread.

- Exception-Resist: If some client logout or just close socket, the server will still service other client insted of crashing.

- Reusable bind: If server crash, the bind port will be occupied for a while. This feature makes server reuse same port to listen possible.
